I change a lot of things, I replace the name id for adventure into friend, and replace the content with some of my friends game id.I deleted the pre and post, and replace with place. Also, added in drink and game to make it more complexity. 

The effect I am trying to achieve is having my friends gather and have fun. The name on the first line is the game id we have in our group. Also, I want the audience to have a feeling that they are also invited to the party just to relax. I think I did achieve the effect because I am using a chill way to invite people into the party.
